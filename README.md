# 2kScraper

A python script for scraping the NBA 2k ratings of NBA players and exporting them to a CSV file. My end goal is to create a program to simulate NBA games and predict playoff series.

### Prerequisites
This script uses BeautifulSoup to parse through data on 2kratings.com

```
pip install bs4
```

## Running the program

```
python main.py
```
